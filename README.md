# AI-Driven Hybrid Models for Enhanced Energy Demand Forecasting in Smart Grids

## üìå Overview
This repository contains the datasets used in the research paper **"AI-Driven Hybrid Models for Enhanced Energy Demand Forecasting in Smart Grids."** The datasets contain historical energy consumption data from various U.S. power grids. These datasets can be useful for energy demand forecasting, time-series analysis, and AI-based modeling.

## üìÇ Datasets
Each dataset consists of **hourly energy consumption (MW)** recorded over several years.
